Agile

1.1 As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to understand how this product integrates with my current setup so that i can start using it quicky without losing any time and functionality.
1.2 As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to provide a well decumented training tutorial to my team so that theu can quicly become familiar with the product and start using it.

2 User Story - as a product mamager trying to convinve my team to use Gigglebit, i would like to have access to documentations and examples ot show how gigglebit is better than the existing version control systems to show its benefits.
2.1 Task - Create onboarding tutorial for developers. 
2.2 Ticket 1 - Create tutorial for initial repo setup.
  Develop a video tutorial that guides developers on how to set up their first repository in GiggleGit including adding files and committing changes.
2.2 Ticket 2 - Create a tuttorial for using memes in merges.
  Develop a tutorial that explains the process of performing merge with memes in GiggleGit.

3 The user story doesnt tell us why the user needs authentication on a new machine. A good user story shoukd tell the required action and the logic behind that acton. This is more of a requirement.
